        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our URL
            shortening
            service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect the following information when you use our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The short URL:</strong> The shortened URL created by you.</li>
            <li><strong>The Long URL:</strong> The original URL that you provide for shortening.</li>
            <li><strong>Create time:</strong> The date and time when the URL was created.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving our URL shortening
            service.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Sharing Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as necessary to comply with the law or
            respond to legal requests.</p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect the information stored in our database.</p>

        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>Since no URL shortening is directly linked to any individual, deletions of shortened URLs can only be
            requested if they violate our site's policies or if the destination page causes harm. Users must provide
            proof that the URL points to them personally to request deletion under these conditions. To exercise these
            rights, please contact us through the details provided on our contact page.</p>

        <h2>6. Administrative Control</h2>
        <p>Website administrators have full control to delete links created by any user to maintain the integrity and
            security of the service.</p>
